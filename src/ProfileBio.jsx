                     Hello! My name is Alan, I'm a gamedev enthusiast, trying to do some art along the way.
                     My main focus is gameplay programmer, I've been using Unity for about <b>5 years</b>. Currently learning Godot.

                     I consider myself an experimentation expert. I love to delve into diverse gamedev areas, just out of curiosity or to find a way to solve a self-imposed problem.
